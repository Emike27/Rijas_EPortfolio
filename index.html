  function showReflection(week) {
    const reflections = {
      week1: "Since the demo is conducted thru online class, it is very important that you make your teaching style interactive because you are not able to see physically your students. Make sure that the internet is stable. Make sure also to recognize your students when they are answering, specially in chats. Have a backup plan. ",
      week2: "I have learned that we should maximize our instructional materials and ensure they fit well in the classroom. We must also consider our voice tone, especially in large rooms, and keep the students engaged by asking thought-provoking questions. When presenting your motivation, it should be really interactive so that the students will be energized already. But consider also that in having a motivation which is the ice breaker, it should not be time consuming. Because some students will only remember the motivation part, not the lesson proper. And in presenting a Visual Aids, make sure that the handwritten is readable or pleasing to the eyes of your students. Good handwriting is also important because it is one of the factors why student really learn, when we write in blackboard or whiteboard. It should also be visible, even at the back. Make sure also that your voice is well-modulated, assess yourself if you are speaking loud like you are already shouting, and of course if you're voice is very quiet. We should assess those things because it is important in teaching, so the students might hear you loud and clear that is not hurtful in our ears.",
      week3: "This week made me realize how important it is to be flexible when managing the class. Planning is important, but quick decision-making and adaptability during unexpected situations are just as crucial. 'Cause this is my Demo Week, I have realized a lot of things to do and not to do. I have learned to modulate your voice specially when you already knew your classroom setting. You should know if you're speaking too loud or too little because it's our weapon in teaching, our voice. Also, I have learned that in presenting your presentation, you must consider the text, like right uses of Capital and Small letters, because some students are still confused about when is the right time to use both of them specially in presenting. Also make sure that you are really prepared in your topic, be confident when you're in front because if they find you distracted, they will not gain their attention to you. Have the voice that is authorative but calm. It is also important to give your students nthe compliments when they are reciting or doing good in your class. Do not practice having a bias in your classroom because that is one factor of not being an effective teacher. ",
      week4: "Always make sure that your voice is loud and clear. modulate your voice. make sure to give your instructions very clear that even yourself can understand and to your students. Well done executed. The presentation must be not text-heavy. The explanation must be yours to say. Make sure in our every activity we have a proper instructions that they will see, even in quiz. Make sure to practice it too. Make sure that your students understand the instruction very well. Read first the intructions yourself before delivering it to the students. Make sure also that the motivation part must be not really time consuming specially when you only have a time limit to teach. Because the lesson proper must consume more and the activity part in your teaching time. TIME MANAGEMENT. In giving an activity, give the students a scenario or a picture for their reference, not only imagination. You have to provide so that they can better understand what to do and speak. Make sure also that your presentation is readable from front to end, even in your instructional materials (handouts) must be readable because not all students have good eyesight, you have to adjust even though you don't have any idea of your students. It is better to move around the classroom too. Your voice should be commanding so that your students would listen to you and will give their full attention on you. If there are no volunteers to recite, call someone to save time. Ask your students where you think they can relate. Don't rely to your one question, make adjustments. Have an energetic class. Have strategy when teaching, it is really important so it will be interactive and fun.",
      week5: "I've realized the importance of consistent pacing and time management in teaching. It’s also important to maintain connection with the students to keep their motivation high. In our last week of demo teaching. I've learned that when presenting your lesson proper specially the topic is more on skills, you should really demonstrate it by yourself in front of the class, or if there's no really resources available, make sure to have a video presentation about the topic, and audible for everyone if it has sounds. Also, make sure that you really know your topic, so when your students asks you a questions, you are able to give them the answer. And again, always assess if your students understand what you're talking about in front, instructions, discussions and assignment. So you know yourself that your students are learning. Make adjustments for your students, even if it's at the moment. It's better to make actions than leaving your students confused in your topic/discussion. Everything will be better, just do your best. Take a deep breath and give it all. "
